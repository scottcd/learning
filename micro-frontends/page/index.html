        <h1>Microfrontends</h1>
        <p>Using <strong><abbr title="server-side includes">SSI</abbr></strong> with nginx and Docker to implement a
            micro-frontend.</p>

        <h3>Server-Side Composition: Server-Side Includes</h3>
        <p>The next section
            is all rendered in the server via nginx ssi (the user
            receives the finished page). This can be independently
            updated and deployed. This can be
            further optimized for zero-downtime and much more!
        </p>

        <h3>Client-Side Composition: Web Components</h3>
        <p>This button is rendered completely in javascript. I'll
            need to buff up my javascript to do much more..<br>
            This can be used in conjuction with SSI to acquire
            universal rendering.
